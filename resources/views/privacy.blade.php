    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>In plain ol' English</h2>
    <p>Location information can be very private and sensitive. It's no joke, so that's why we don't store anything we don't
        need to, we ensure privacy by default, and we make all our code open-source.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>When you create a map and you are logged out, none of your personal information is stored on our servers.</li>
        <li>When you create a marker/incident on the map and you are logged out, none of your personal information is stored
            on our servers.</li>
        <li>When you are logged in, we associate any actions you take and rescources you make (like creating a map or a
            marker) with your account, so that you can access it at a later time and on other devices.</li>
        <li>When you consent to analytics cookies, we share personally identifying info (such as your IP address) with
            Google Analytics, Facebook, and Hotjar. This data is NOT stored on our servers. We're not interested in your
            individual data, we look for usage patterns on the website which helps us continuously improve everyones
            experience.</li>
